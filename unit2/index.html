		<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.rga.com/" target="_blank">RGA</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.hugeinc.com/" target="_blank">Huge INC</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.akqa.com/" target="_blank">AKQA</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Inspiration is difficult to quantify. Since this unit is really about visual design and design also has to be function according to Dieter Rams we must not ignore how the design influences the user behavior.  Therefore I used a series of quantitative variables for determining functionality of the site and assigned qualitative variables for several visual stimuli. Then assigned these variables a given value to come up with a total inspiration value. These variables included engagement, intuitiveness, visual appeal and post-bounce satisfaction.</p>
			<p>Engagement- Metric Weight .3- I determined engagement by calculating variables such as unique page visits (p), session length (l), and completed conversions (v) with variable rates of .3, .3 and .4 respectively. These variable values make up the overall engagement weight score (.3).</p>
			<p>Intuitiveness- Metric Weight .2- I determined the intuitiveness of the site by qualitative variable ease of use (h). Ease of use describes how easy and natural it was to browse the site based on location of buttons and its content hierarchy. This variable value makes up the overall intuitiveness weight score (.2).</p>
			<p>Visual Appeal- Metric Weight .2 - I determined visual appeal by qualitative variables such as effectiveness of space(s), size (z) and balance (b) with variable weights of .3, .3 and .4 respectively. It is arguable that these variables can also be used to determine site functionality, but I have decided to use these variables solely for visual appeal based on simply leap of faith assumptions that these would more efficiently reflect the visual appeal segment. These variable values make up the overall visual appeal weight score (.2).</p>
			<p>Post-Bounce Satisfaction- Metric Weight .3- I determined the post-bounce satisfaction level (t) through qualitative variables such as a rating of how much I enjoyed the site after leaving the page. Leaving the page would force me to rely on the entire experience without my opinion influenced of visual bias. This variable value makes up the overall post-bounce satisfaction weight score (.3).</p>
			<p>After calculating the grand total of points for each website R/GA came in 3rd with a score of 7.036. In second place, was AKQA with a total score of 8.16. In first place was HUGE with a total score of 10.62. Therefore, HUGE was the most inspirational of the three marketing websites</p>
		<h3>Here is how I calculated the total score of each site</h3>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
			<p>These sites are similar in several ways; the first and most obvious similarity I found was the use of negative space as padding between texts other content types. This outline of the content made it much easier to identify content I would be interested in. All sites had a large number of unique page views ranging anywhere between 8-13 pages. Also, all sites had a strong visual appeal utilizing large “in-your-face” content size and symmetrical balance to create a great looking site. In addition, all sites ranked high in post-bounce satisfaction (how much did I like and remember the site after I had already left.) Lastly, I noticed a contact link was visible from every page on the site either located at the header or footer.</p>
			<p>Some things I would say is different between the chosen sites would be that R/GA had the majority of their content be text, whereas Huge was primarily visual picture links and AKQA were a comfortable mixture of both text and visual links. Additionally, the main menus for R/GA and AKQA were both the standard inline 5 page menu at the top of the page. However, Huge had a scroll down menu located in the top right corner, which had a style resembling a mobile menu. I thought this menu was intuitive since I browse on mobile devices frequently, I immediately understood that this was a menu and I thought it complimented Huge’s minimalistic style quite well.</p>
